# soon:

this will be a library comprising the logic that was in a prior set of hardcoded lambdas

preference:

* this package contains all pieces needed to plug tapestry into any given consumer's environment.
* supported:
  1. lower-level raw component pieces exposed with nice api. all of the following will hook into these raw parts
  2. ezpz-plugin-to-koa helpers
  3. ezpz-plugin-to-express helpers
  4. ezpz-plugin-to-lambdas helpers
  5. ... other ezpz plugins ...
  6. all-in-one premade node-app

this needs to be the most pluggable piece of tapestry, so should be super flexible
